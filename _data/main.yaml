  - summary: "18th HiRSE Seminar - Neil Chue Hong: Can Software Metrics Improve Software Quality?"
    #id: test1
    description: |
      Software quality in computational science and engineering can be interpreted in two ways: does the software implement the algorithm or simulate the phenomenon as expected, and does it perform as expected i.e. does it scale, is it maintainable, is it secure?

      Software metrics are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements based on the analysis of source code. Others, such as those being developed by the CHAOSS initiative, focus on measuring the ability of a project to deliver software that meets various criteria, such as community health or development efficiency.

      A key question is how useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to development in computational science and engineering, which can differ from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear requirements, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures, and focus on performance.

      I will consider which types of software metric might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be identified by considering the differences in the way that software is developed these fields?

    location: The talk will be held online. The connection details will be posted on a variety on channels shortly before the event (see <https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/series/2023_06_27-seminar_18.html> for a list).

      How to install high-performant software on a High Performance Cluster?

      Software installation on a High Performance Cluster (HPC) is different from the usual software installation on a desktop 
      computer.In order to get the best performance out of the very expensive hardware, it is best to compile software from source, 
      rather than using pre-compiled binaries. This sounds often easier than it actually is. One good example is Basic Linear Algebra 
      Subprograms (BLAS) [1]: A generic installation will only deliver a very low performance. Optimising the compile process will 
      deliver more performance. However, with the sheer amount of different CPUs around, testing it for each new build with a new 
      compiler is time consuming.

      The solution here is to fall back what others have done, improve on it if possible and contribute back to the community.

      One such an example is EasyBuild [2]: software which is installing high-performant scientific software on HPC clusters 
      automatically.

      The talk will take you through an often a bit personally journey of scientific software installation, without too much of technical 
      jargon. It is aimed for scientists who are installing software, or write their own code. Equally, researchers who are more 
      experienced in software installation might learn something new as well.

  - summary: Cambridge RSE Seminar - Code Execution during peer review with CODECHECK - Daniel Nust
    description: |
      Data and software are the foundation for a vast variety and volume of computational
      research in all scientific disciplines. This is how we make sense of small and huge
      datasets using everything from one-off scripts to high-performance computing
      infrastructures. Nowadays, most of these works are eventually presented to a
      scientific community in form of a paper for the recognition of research outputs and
      career advancement. Research papers are increasingly accompanied by data and
      software to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and reusability. This change
      is driven by shifting community practice as well as by publisher guidelines.
      However, the actual inspection of these building blocks is not a common part
      of the publication and peer review process. The CODECHECK initiative tries to make
      code execution standard practice in peer review using a particular focus and a set
      of principles. We present variants of CODECHECK and highlight the possibilities
      for research software engineers to participate in academic peer review as codecheckers.
      Furthermore, we demonstrate the AGILE conference’s Reproducibility Review as a
      concrete implementation of CODECHECK . The Reproducible AGILE initiative
      demonstrates how good scientific and development practices can be encouraged
      and spread through communication and collaboration.

      Daniel is a research software engineer and postdoc at the Chair of Geoinformatics,
      TU Dresden, Germany. He develops tools for open and reproducible geoscientific
      research and is a proponent for open scholarship and reproducibility in the projects
      NFDI4 Earth (<https://nfdi4earth.de/>), OPTIMETA (<https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta>), and CODECHECK (<https://codecheck.org.uk/>).

      under my EPSRC RSE Fellowship: ‘Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity and
      Inclusion) in the R Project’, that are designed to encourage and train a new, more
      diverse, generation of contributors.

      The initiatives vary from regular support on the R Contributor Slack and in R
      Contributor Office Hours, to one-off events aimed at new contributors such as a
      Collaboration Campfire series and a Bug BBQ . I will report back on the recent R
      Project Sprint 2023, hosted at Warwick University, which brought members of the R
      Core Team together with both novice and experienced contributors to work in
      collaboration – the first event of this kind in the R community. I will discuss how

  - summary: Cambridge RSE Seminar - Sustainability at The Netherlands eScience Center - Niels Drost
    description: |
      The Netherlands eScience Center is the Dutch national expertise center for research
      software. We work with researchers from across the Netherlands and beyond, in all
      fields of research on creating and using research software, as well as building
      capacity through teaching, fellowships, and other community efforts.

      We are passionate about making software sustainable (as in durable) so that it can
      be used by as many researchers as possible. To facilitate this we created the
      Research Software Directory (<https://research-software-directory.org/>), a service
      to show the impact of research software.

      A re-occurring theme in our projects is that of sustainability (as in climate change).
      Over the years we have contributed to a number of projects and software related to
      sustainability, including ESM Valtool (<https://esmvaltool.org/>), software supporting
      the evaluation of Earth system models, and used in the latest IPCC report.

      In my presentation I will explain the structure of the eScience Center and how it
      came to be, introduce the research software directory, and provide some examples
      of projects in the area of sustainability we contribute to.

      Niels Drost is a Research Software Engineer from the Netherlands. He is currently
      the Programme Manager for Environment and Sustainability at the Netherlands eScience
      Center. He has a background in Computer Science in the area of High Performance
      Computing, helped establish the Dutch chapter of the RSE community (NL-RSE,
      <https://nl-rse.org/>), and has worked on many different research projects over
      the years, mostly in the fields of Climate Science and Hydrology.

      archives, libraries and museums. The CDH Learning programme offers a 'Best Practices
      in Coding for Digital Humanities' series and runs a RSE Methods Fellows programme
      for RSEs (of any discipline) to teach workshops and prepare online tutorials.
      CDH also hosts a Digital Humanities (DH) RSE Summer School (together with several
      partner institutions) with the aim of introducing those who code in research to
      beginner and intermediate RSE practices. This is an exciting time for RSE in DH
      and these recent initiatives are still in the process of active development. In
      this talk I will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities of making RSE
      relevant to the various types of research under the ‘DH umbrella’, how best to
      engage DH scholars and RSEs from other disciplines in this joint endeavour, and
      where this might take us next.

  - summary: Cambridge RSE Seminar - How not to write a convection parameterisation code? - Mike Whitall
    description: |
      Convection parameterisations are a crucial element of global atmospheric models.
      They simulate the vertical transport of heat, moisture and momentum by convective
      clouds, and associated rainfall. The majority of Tropical rainfall is associated
      with these clouds, which are too small-scale to explicitly resolve on the model’s
      grid and so need to be parameterised.

      Most global atmosphere models use a so-called 'mass-flux' form of convection
      parameterisation, which consists of a diagnostic vertical integral to compute the
      properties of the clouds and the amount of heat / moisture entrained / detrained
      at each height. The calculations in a given vertical column of model grid-points
      are completely independent of those in other neighbouring columns, so it would be
      simplest to write the code so that it only considers a single column at a time.
      However, since we are performing a vertical integral the calculations at a given
      height within each column depend on the results from those calculations at the
      level below, so the scheme must be structured in a vertically sequential manner
      considering a single height-level at a time.

      Considering only a single column and a single height-level at a time amounts to
      computing only a single grid-point at a time. On CPU architectures, this is
      extremely inefficient; far greater computation speeds are obtained by doing many
      identical calculations simultaneously, via vectorisation. Another challenge/opportunity
      is the sparsity of the required calculations, since convective clouds only occupy a
      small fraction of the atmosphere’s volume.

      In this talk I discuss routes to exploiting both vectorisation and shared memory
      parallelisation, and how to make efficient use of memory given the sparsity, in the
      comorph convection parameterisation fortran code currently under development at the
      Met Office.

      However, current and future changes in software and HPC architectures (such as GPUs)
      may radically change the optimal code structure. Is there any way to adapt our
      convection code to these changes without completely rewriting it, or write it in a
      'future proof' way?

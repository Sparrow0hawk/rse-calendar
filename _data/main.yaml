      SocRSE trustee Martin O'Reilly will be giving one of the PyData London
      keynotes on 4 June 2023. It will be on the topic of RSEs and similar
      roles, exploring the similarities and differences between these and
      equivalent non-R(esearch) roles and how people can make the transition
      from non-R roles to RSE roles and similar.

      Are you curious about what is going with AI in the media and all the
      safety considerations and how one might be able to contribute? Then this
      talk is for you! 

      Title: Surveying AI Safety Research Directions
      Speaker: Dan Hendrycks (Center for AI Safety)
      Location: Zoom [<https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/84463604528>, passcode: DanHEdi23]
      RSVP[free]: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/638192339467?aff=ai>
      Abstract: ML systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new
      capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. In
      this presentation, I'll give a whirlwind tour of directions in safety,
      namely withstanding hazards (“Robustness”), identifying hazards
      (“Monitoring”), reducing inherent ML system hazards (“Alignment”).

  - summary: "AI Beyond STEM: digital skills to unleash the power of data science and AI for all"
    #id: test1
    description: |
      Hosted by SocRSE Trustee David Beavan, what are the AI skills (and RSEs
      are part of that, right) needed in the big world outside of STEM? This
      online-only panel event will bring together experts from diverse
      backgrounds, including digital humanities, linguistics, zoology, and more,
      to discuss the digital skills that are essential for future success in
      their fields. We will explore the specific challenges and opportunities of
      applying these technologies in non-STEM fields and gather ideas for next
      steps in developing the necessary skills and knowledge. Then it is over to
      you, the audience, to pose questions of the panel and share your
      experiences.

  - summary: Byte-sized RSE session 8 - README files
    #id: test1
    description: |
      In this final session of the first series of byte-sized RSE, we'll look at
      the humble README file! Not a default and often ignored file in the root
      of your project directory but a hugely important place for a range of
      information that can make or break the success of your project - join us
      on Tuesday 6th June to learn more.  

      Registration now open - <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYbd6vIrL-Irm_DROs74OTEUkT_84PEv12s7UhiBjfuGhGbA/viewform>

      Our next Research Software Camp is taking place from 19 to 30 June 2023. Find out more about the Research Software Camp. 
      The Software Sustainability Institute runs free online Research Software Camps
      once a year over the course of two weeks. Each Camp focusses on introducing
      basic research software skills and good practices, as well offering one.

  - summary: "18th HiRSE Seminar - Neil Chue Hong: Can Software Metrics Improve Software Quality?"
    #id: test1
    description: |
      Software quality in computational science and engineering can be interpreted in two ways: does the software implement the algorithm or simulate the phenomenon as expected, and does it perform as expected i.e. does it scale, is it maintainable, is it secure?

      Software metrics are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements based on the analysis of source code. Others, such as those being developed by the CHAOSS initiative, focus on measuring the ability of a project to deliver software that meets various criteria, such as community health or development efficiency.

      A key question is how useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to development in computational science and engineering, which can differ from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear requirements, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures, and focus on performance.

      I will consider which types of software metric might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be identified by considering the differences in the way that software is developed these fields?

    location: The talk will be held online. The connection details will be posted on a variety on channels shortly before the event (see <https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/series/2023_06_27-seminar_18.html> for a list).

  - summary: Educating Engineers for Safe AI Workshop (Cambridge)
    description: |
      The Alan Turing Institute, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Cambridge and UCL Universities are organising a series of workshops to discuss Educating Engineers for Safe AI.

      We are seeking participants in this workshop series who are:

      - AI Engineers, Data Scientists, Systems Engineers, ML-Ops, Research Software Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers and more, working in the implementation of AI systems OR
      - Academics and other experts working in areas related to Safe, Ethical, Reliable and Trustworthy Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence OR
      - Academics and other experts working in professional education, CPD, and related areas, interested in developing materials related to safe AI for professional audiences.
      The workshops consist of two regional nonresidential satellite workshops in Cambridge (4th July) and in Edinburgh (29th June), and a final residential workshop in Newcastle on the 15th and 16th August.

      The purpose of the workshop series is to develop a roadmap toward the creation of a syllabus and set of professional education materials, targeted at software and systems engineers, so that they can be empowered to champion the creation of safe, ethical and trustworthy AI in their workplaces. Developers and engineers, appropriately empowered and skilled, are uniquely placed to ensure that the systems they build are done so according to emerging ethical best practice. These materials will become part of The Turing Way project.
